## 2. Developer's recommendations
1. Sometimes Firebase takes a lot of time to send you a verification email to your university email address. So, we recommend you use this email since you can use both the staff role and the normal user role via this account.

2. Try not to run our code on a browser since we developed our project for mobile applications. Therefore, if you use it in a browser, the text fonts and interface may not be the same as the application on mobile.

## 3. Some problems that may occur
1. If your verified email comes late or you want to use the sport staff role: We recommend you use this email since you can use both the staff role and the normal user role via this account.
